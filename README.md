# Mili shitty flowers

My life has 
always been
the flowers stuck on the piece of shit

dripping down my forehead
is my piece of shit

facing
hiding
drowning
failing
surrinding
escaping
merging 
surviving

when you took my hand
I became alive
when you step on my shit
I wanted to die 

you are my god of dead
the angel of light
you make me wanna die

the shit is got a ugly and dry
but the flower on the shit it won't die

around around around it goes swirling up high
almost reaching dreams that I've left behind 

shit has gotten angry and tired 
the flower on the shit, it won't mine
If only you could water me one more time
the next time we meet
with forest we'll be one
